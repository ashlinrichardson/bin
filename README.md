# bin

In the Unix/Linux tradition, various things that I keep in a ~/bin/ folder. A "posix" system is assumed (like Mac, Linux, or even MinGW or Cygwin on Windows) although many of the programs / scripts are intended to be translatable between platforms

Since I program to analyze images a lot, there's a number of Python and/or C/C++ programs for programming and image analysis, incl. but not limited to hyperspectral or polarimetric radar image work

Some code from PolSARPro is included. Reimaginations or revitalizations of some utilities developed while at the Advanced Forest Technologies group (Pacific Forestry Centre) are also available
