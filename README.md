python src/setup.py

## background
In Unix tradition, I keep some things in a ~/bin/ folder. "Posix" system is assumed (Mac, Linux, or even MinGW or Cygwin on Windows) although many scripts can translate between platforms. A number of scripts relating to image analysis, multispectral imaging, and polarimetry are included. Some excerpts from PolSARPro is included. Revitalized versions of some utilities developed with Advanced Forest Technologies group (Pacific Forestry Centre) are included
