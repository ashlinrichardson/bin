# bin
In Unix tradition, we keep scripts in a ~/bin/ folder. A number of scripts relating to image analysis, multispectral imaging and polarimetry are included. Revitalized versions of some utilities developed with Advanced Forest Technologies group (Pacific Forestry Centre) are included. Some excerpts from the PolSARPro software are included

## howto
**python src/setup.py**

## req'ts
"Posix" system is assumed (Mac, Linux, or even MinGW or Cygwin on Windows) although many scripts multiplatform

## sample output
**scm** "Shane Cloude Method" (a visualization method of Dr. Shane Cloude for fully-polarimetric SAR data) example output shown using MDA Radarsat2 Vancouver test data:
